OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION


If you ever get lost when dealing with a feature of Pine Script, it's always worth checking the official documentation. TradingView have done a great job of providing code examples for most features of Pine.

The reason why this course is so helpful to so many traders is because I tend to break down the features of Pine Script in a more intuitive and practical way to understand, because most of the written documentation is fairly convoluted (as it's written by programmers - not traders).

But with that being said, the official documentation can be extremely helpful if you run into a problem that hasn't yet been covered in my course material, so here are the two resources you will need to bookmark:
